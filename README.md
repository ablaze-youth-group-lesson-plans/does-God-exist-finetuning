A. it is estimated that the there are between 10^78 to 10^82

- each week we're going to examine one of these 8 things that Wallace points out
- last week we kind of looked at the fact that the universe began which is a powerful argument for God
- today we'll look at the Fine-tuning evidence and examine why it's a powerful argument for the existence of God.

# Station 1 - Is Fine-Tuning the result of chance?

Q. Imagine buying a new car and discovering on your 'first drive' that the radio was tuned to your favourite stations and your favourite snacks were in the center console. What would you assume?

Q. What difference would it make if you learned that the entire universe had been prepared for you in advance? (For example, the conditions of our universe, solar system, planets including Earth are delicately balanced and finely calibrated that the slightest modification of these conditions would be disastrous for life)

- Read Psalm 8:3-4
  Q. What does this verse tell us about the heart that God has for His creation?

Q. What specifically, does this tell us about God's heart for humans?

Last week we looked at the word 'chance' in context with the flipping of the coin.
We learned last week that chance does not have the power to influence the next event. It's simply a word to describe
mathematical probabilities. Chance has no power, because chance is not a being -- it's non-being. Chance is not a thing at all, it is no-thing, it is nothing. So when scientists say the universe was created by chance - then they're saying the universe was created by a non-being that has no power to do anythihng -- which is illogical - because nothing can't create something.

Q. When scientists say the appearance of fine-tuning is a result of coincidence - is that a satisfying answer when explaining the fine-tuning of the universe?

# Station 2 - Is Fine-Tuning the result of physical necessity? (it just had to be that way)

Look at the 3 fine-tuning charts printed out (finetune.docx)

Q. Some cosmologists believe the universe is the way it is because the laws of physics do not allow any alternative (if the laws of nature are fixed and inflexible, no other versions of these laws are possible). - is that a satisfying answer when explaining the fine-tuning of the universe?

Q. Is there is reason to believe the laws of nature could have been different?

Q. Even if the foundational laws of the universe were fixed, does this explain the regional and locational fine-tuning examples?

- Read Romans 1:20
  Q. If the laws of physics we observe in the universe are simply the reflection of one of God's "invisible attributes," what does this tell us about the nature of God?

# Station 3 - Is Fine-Tuning the result of a multiverse?

A multiverse is a theory that says our universe is simply generated and is one of an infinite number of universes, so it's not surprising that we have a universe that is fine-tuned, since out of an infinite universes, you're bound to have one 'cosmic accident' that's finely tuned.

To some physicists, the multiverse has the best chance of explaining the appearance of fine-tuning in our universe.

Q. If a multiverse generator exists, would it be more or less fine-tuned than the universes it generates? (A. you can't escape the fine-tuned problem, you're just one level removed from explaining the problem)
Q. Does the multiverse theory point to inside the room or outside the room? (A. outside, since it would be outside space, time and matter)
Q. Yet scientists assume a multiverse generator is spatial, temporal and has material properties - is that reasonable given the previous answer? (A. it's contradictory, and doesn't explain how the multiverse generator began to exist)

- Read Romans 1:21-22 - do you see any connection as why smart people with Ph.D's aren't willing to see the evidence that God exists?

# Station 4 - Is Fine-Tuning the result of design?

Play the video file "EverybodyAgrees.mp4"

Read all the fine-tuned examples, then ask yourself the following:

Q. What kind of being could create the universe from nothing yet act purposefully enough to design a universe fine-tuned for life?

* If God so carefully made the universe with such precision, what does this say about his genius? His precision?
  His care for the finest details?

Matt 6:26 - "Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"

Since He creates with infinite precision so that life is even possible, and since God values you more than the birds, then what kind of plan does He have in mind for your life if you will trust Him? If God can create a universe with such astronomical precision, then what kind of astronomical love does He have for you?

Not only did this God design the universe to such intricate details so as to permit life, but more importantly He also provided a way to eternal life. Jesus called Himself as "the way". What kind of God would plan from eternity to send His Son Jesus to die in Your place on the cross, a substitutionary atonement for Your sins so that if you believe/trust that Jesus is Lord, that He rose from the dead, then you will have eternal life.

If this is how God designs the universe with mind-boggling numerical odds, will you not think He can use your life's tragedies, sufferings and turn it around, intricately, even using the very thing that hurted you in the past, to be the best design feature, for your good and the good of others you help along the way. For "in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." - Rom 8:28

Do you love Him? Will you love Him today? So you too can be part of his purpose, plan and design?
